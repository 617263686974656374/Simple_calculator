# Simple_calculator
A basic calculator program in Java. It prompts the user to input two numbers and select an operation (addition, subtraction, division, or multiplication) from a menu. The program then performs the chosen operation on the numbers and displays the result. If an invalid operation is selected, it asks the user to enter the correct option.
